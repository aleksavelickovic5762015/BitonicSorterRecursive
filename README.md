# BitonicSorterRecursive
Master's thesis - Hardware digital sorting network

Recursive implementation of bitonic sorter in Chisel.

These two implementations were the starting point: <br />
Iterative implementation in Chisel - https://github.com/freechipsproject/ip-contributions/tree/master/src/main/scala/chisel/lib/bitonicsorter <br />
Recursive implementation in Python - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bitonic-sort/

Project can be opened in Intellij. After opening project, execute `sbt test` in project directory to run tests.
